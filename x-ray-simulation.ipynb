    "# Monte Carlo simulation of X-ray imaging\n",

    "The two main interaction processes between photon and matter is the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering. The photoelectric effect is a process where an electron with energy E is absorbed by an atom. The process where a photon interacts with an outer electron of an atom, leading to a change in the photons energy and direction is known as Compton scattering. When taking these two effects into account, we assume that there is a probability p of a photon being absorbed or scattered when moving a small distance x to $x+\\Delta x$. (And a probability of 1-p of it moving through unhindered.)\n",
    "If we assume that the intensity of a photon beam is equal to $I(x)$, the above assumption would mean that the expected intensity of the beam at $x + \\Delta x$ is equal to \n",

    "$I(x+\\Delta x) = I(x)(1-p) + 0*p \\,\\,\\,\\,(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of this notebook will look at x-ray imaging in one direction. The space it moves through is discretized into N different sections, where each distance is given by $\\Delta x$. In this project the assumption that $p = \\mu \\Delta x$ will be made, where $\\mu$ is the so-called attenuation coefficient. The attenuation coefficient describes the extent at which the radiant flux of a beam reduces as it moves through a material.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearranging the terms in (1), plugging in the definition of the probability p, and considering infitesimal steps ($\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0$), we get the differential equation\n",

    "\n",
    "where $I_0$ is the initial intensity of the beam. This analytical solution will be used to measure how good the numerical approximation is.\n",
